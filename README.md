# DecisionTree-Drug-Classification
This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict which drug (A, B, C, X, or Y) a patient might respond to, based on their medical attributes. The workflow includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Encoding categorical features like Sex, BP, and Cholesterol.
2.**Train-Test Split** – Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training** – Training a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data. 
4. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluating performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. 
5. **Making Predictions** – Using the trained model to predict drug type for new patients.
